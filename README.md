# AP Computer Science A - Unit 2 Section 7

# `String` Methods

This section of the objects unit is meant to continue using `String` objects to further our understanding of object-oriented programming.

Due to the nature of Java, certain elements of a Java program are going to be taken for granted and ultimately ignored as we work with the basics, but are required for the program to run successfully. I encourage you to read them and start to internalize them as they'll become a key aspect of the work we do as the year goes on.

This section covers the following material:

- APIs, Libraries, and Packages
- Object `toString` Methods
- `String` Length and Indexing
- `String` `substring` Methods
- `String` `indexOf` Method
- `String` `equals` and `compareTo` Methods

To use this repository, start with the `notes.md` document, referencing the various `.java` documents as you go to see the examples in action.

Once you have completed the assignment, save the Java files and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
