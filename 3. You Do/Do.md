# You Do

Make three different `String` variables that hold the following `String` objects:
- `"Public junk dwarves quiz mighty fox"`
- `"The five boxing wizards jump quickly"`
- `"When zombies arrive, quickly fax judge Pat"`

For **each** of the `String` variables above, do the following:
- Print the length of the `String` as a sentence that looks like `"The length of the string is #"`.
- Print out the substring starting at index 10 and ending at index 26 (does not include 26) as a sentence that looks like `"The substring is _"`.
- Print out the substring starting at index 17 and goes through the rest of the `String` as a sentence that looks like `"The substring is _"`.
- Print out the index of the first occurence of a space character `" "` as a sentence that looks like `"The first index of " " is #"`.
- Check if the second letter of any of the `String` variables match each other.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
