# Basics Check

Make a `String` variable with the value `"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"`. Using that variable do the following:
- Print the length of the `String` as a sentence that looks like `"The length of the string is #"`.
- Print out the substring starting at index 13 and ending at index 24 (includes index 24) as a sentence that looks like `"The substring is _"`.
- Print out the substring starting at index 5 and goes through the rest of the `String` as a sentence that looks like `"The substring is _"`.
- Print out the index of the first occurence of a space character `" "` as a sentence that looks like `"The first index of " " is #"`.
- Print out the result of whether the substring from the first index to (and including) the index of the character `"e"` is equivalent to the `String` `"The"`.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
