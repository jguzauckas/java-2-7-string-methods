# Understanding Check

This will use the `Person` class defined in `Person.java` from the notes.

Create three people and save them to variables:
- Yourself
- A family member
- One of your friends

With **each** of those people, do the following:
- Print out the sentence `"FirstName LastInitial is # years old"` (example: `"John G is 25 years old"`).
- Print out the sentence `"FirstInitial LastName is # years old"` (example: `"J Guzauckas is 25 years old"`).
- Print out the character at index 9 of their full name (first and last name combined with a space in between) as a sentence like `"The 10th character of FirstName LastName is Character"` (example: `"The 10th character of John Guzauckas is c"`).

Finally, do the following:
- Check if the variables for you and your family member share the same last name (check if the last names are equal).
- Compare the full names (first and last name combined with a space in between) of each person.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
